### For now, here is the main idea behind it:
A website with a chat where you can summon the oracle. In a chat with two or more people, it will be possible to summon ChatGPT to converse mutually. One idea I have is that the room will have an admin, and the system will be similar to the "raise hand" feature of Google Meet. When clicking the "call the oracle" button, a queue will form starting from whoever raises their hand. Once ChatGPT finishes responding to one person, the admin chooses the next person to receive a response.
